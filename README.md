REQUEST HEADER PARSER API
==========================

Delivers device info as a JSON. This is just an api. It was developed by me while learning from FreeCodeCamp (FCC).

On the front-end,
- Absolutely nothing

On the back-end,

- frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- Barebones logic in js
- API route in /routes/index.js

Just send a get request to [project URL]/api/whoami
